* created a new import function kyu_BN_readdata.m 
This is different from the obsolete kyu_BN_readdata_combine.m in: 
- it reads data from all the institutions from a single file
- Accordingly, patient identifier (studyid) has a new format 
  institution + 3 digit ID (ex:L002)
- endpoint(class) can be customized (class_name)
- missing data is excluded from odds ratio calculation
* changes in kyu_readphysical.m
- users can specify which variable should be a class through
  an input argument class_name

- 3 Jul 2015 Sangkyu Lee

* added a graph prior construction module
* added a MCMC graph learning module

- 6 Jul 2015 Sangkyu Lee

* kyu_readphysical.m was modified so that :
- it excludes the instances with a missing class 
- pts w/o a class value are assigned 0 for an array pts_to_include
  which will be filtered out by kyu_preprocess.m 
- study IDs for the removed patients are displayed
* kyu_BN_readdata now displays an event rate on a command window
- event rate is defined as a fraction of class==2

- 8 Jul 2015 Sangkyu Lee

* added a bootstrap customization option in KS_Stability.m
- a variable √íBS_institution√ì, when set to 1, force the sampling 
  to preserve the fraction of samples between source institutions
  which is indicated as the first letter of √ístudyid√ì

- 20 Jul 2015 Sangkyu Lee
* kyu_BN_MCMC_convtest.m was modified so that:
- an option is added to choose a discretization type

- 28 Jul 2015 Sangkyu Lee
* kyu_BN_readdata.m was modified 
- having a column named √ïNumFrac√ï (number of fractions) is mandatory 
  in the source spreadsheet, which is used to filter fractionation group 
- SBRT cohort (SBRTfilter=3) is now defined as NumFrac<=5 (ASTRO policy)

- 30 Jul 2015 Sangkyu Lee
* change in kyu_readbiomarkers.m: installed a safety measure for the 
  MATLAB function xlsread showing inconsistent behaviors  

- 4 Aug 2015 Sangkyu Lee
* kyu_BN_readdata.m: 
- p values for odds ratios available (computed by likelihood ratio test)
- In case of skewed distribution (resulting in 0 counts in a contingency
  table) a pseudo count of 1 is added to each cell of the table

* knnimpute_kyu.m:
- fixed the bug that gives a non-integer value when imputing 
  binary variables
* kyu_BN_readdata.m now reads a metadata .csv file (kyu_readmetadata.m)
  from which units of the variables are imported 
* added kyu_readmetadata.m  
* simplified kyu_preprocess.m to process datasets with and without NaN
  at the same time 
* added a plotting function kyu_plotbins.m for showing discretization 
  distributions and bin boundaries
* KSfilter.m: fixed a bug in setting a blanket
  In low probability,a pair of variables could become identical, 
  which creates error in setting a right blanket 
  (although almost no impact on the selection results with the bug)
* Stability_KS_localparallel.m: 
  KSfilter can now be run parallel in a multicore local machine
  
- 16 Aug 2015 Sangkyu Lee
* added parameter learning/classification testing modules
* fixed a bug of returning nothing for √îloc√ï in occurrence.m 

- 17 Aug 2015 Sangkyu Lee
* fixed a bug in kyu_BN_trainMCMC_L1_BS.m
* added a parallelization option for a KS filter 
  (Stability_KS_localparallel.m)

- 24 Aug 2015 Sangkyu Lee
* KSfilter.m: fixed a bug that occurs when multiple variables record 
  the same CE at each elimination round. In that case, one variable 
  is randomly chosen 
* kyu_BN_readdata.m: fixed a bug related to metadata import

- 10 Sep 2015 Sangkyu Lee
* KSfilter.m: when estimating CE of a random variable, each input 
variable is used as a blanket and an average over all possible blanket
is taken. The resulting CE value might be higher than assuming no blanket
* Solved function name conflict (learn_param.m) occurred at kyu_BN_paramlearn.m:
  a new file learn_params_ml (ML learning of BN parameters) is uploaded 
* Fixed minor bugs in kyu_ParamLearnPredict_submit.m and kyu_BN_BMA.m  

- 15 Sep 2015 Sangkyu Lee
* Fixed the possible bug in kyu_BN_trainMCMC_L1_convtest when it is given a 
  non-zero burn-in length from kyu_BN_MCMC_convtest.m
* kyu_BN_GraphLearning_submit.m: updated the help page

- 17 Sep 2015 Sangkyu Lee
* Fixed the bug in kyu_BN_GraphLearning_collect.m

- 6 Oct 2015 Sangkyu Lee
* Added kyu_BN_univariate.m: evaluates univariate prediction using the 
  variables in a dataset
* organized files into folders. The files won't show any revision history in 
  GitHub, but the following git command will show the history:
  git log -p --follow individual_file_name

- 8 Oct 2015 Sangkyu Lee
* kyu_Perf_632BSplus.m: added more elements to a 632 plus performance object 
- an array of ensemble sizes 
- 632+ bootstrap estimate of class prob. for each examples in the original data
  (.Prob632p). Implemented in kyu_632plusbootstrap_prob.m
* Added a reliability plot (kyu_ReliabilityPlot.m): 
- takes a 632+ perf. object for BN ensemble models
- groups patients into N risk groups, and plots actual vs. bootstrap estimated
  probability from the model
   
- 16 Oct 2015 Sangkyu Lee
* Averaging of class probability for each patient is now done in a separate function 
  AverageProbability_PatbyPat.m (/Utilities/) which led to changes in kyu_BN_ParamLearnPredict_collect.m
* uploaded a function for multivariate logistic model training kyu_LogisticMode.m
* uploaded a DVH reading tools (DVH should be written in .csv by MIMvista)

- 2 Nov 2015 Sangkyu Lee
* getDVHmetrics.m can now compute gEUD. However, this added one more required 
  input argument ‘a’ (a volume parameter from the gEUD model)
* Modified a bootstrap set generation scheme kyu_BN_GeneratePartition.m so that
  randomly sampled testing sets always have both of classes (otherwise AUC wouldn’t
  be able to be calculated)
* added a function that delineates a graph consisting of robust connections 
  estimated from bootstrap tests (can be found in /ParameterLearning/)

- 8 Nov 2015 Sangkyu Lee
* Fixed a bug in AverageProbability_PatbyPat.m
* An output argument “polarity” of kyu_BN_ParamLearnPredict_collect.m is now
  a part of one struct variable “” that contains all the parameter learning 
  results
* kyu_BN_FindRobustStruct.m: 
- Instead of an input argument, an ensemble size is now input via a user prompt during
  function execution. When a user inputs an ensemble size that was not tested, the 
  closest match in ProbsObject.EnsembleSizes is used
- Statistical significance of the links is formally tested using t-distribution: 
  The confidence level should be significantly (p<0.05) higher than a cutoff value
  by Scutari (2013) 

- 15 Jan 2016 Sangkyu Lee
* Data import, pre-processing, and validation modules are revamped to accommodate external validation:
- An object (obj_pp) saving pre-processing parameters (imputation/discretization/normalization) is created within kyu_BN_readdata.m 
- obj_pp is created for training data import and returned as an output argument for
  kyu_BN_readdata.m. For creating a validation dataset, obj_pp is now given as
  an optional input argument kyu_BN_readdata.m.
- kyu_BN_ParamLearnPredict_submit now has an option for external validation available using ‘external’ for an input parameter ‘validation’
* Added kyu_BN_FindRobustStruct: an improved version of graphical display of an BN ensemble 
* kyu_readbiomarkers.m: error handling for imputation (displays warning when there is no data to use)
* kyu_generateDAG changed its input parameters: now it requires maximum fan in (maxfanin) as an input variable
- kyu_BN_trainMCMC_L1_BS.m and kyu_BN_trainMCMC_L1_convtest, which call this function, were corrected accordingly
