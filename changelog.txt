* created a new import function kyu_BN_readdata.m 
This is different from the obsolete kyu_BN_readdata_combine.m in: 
- it reads data from all the institutions from a single file
- Accordingly, patient identifier (studyid) has a new format 
  institution + 3 digit ID (ex:L002)
- endpoint(class) can be customized (class_name)
- missing data is excluded from odds ratio calculation
* changes in kyu_readphysical.m
- users can specify which variable should be a class through
  an input argument class_name

* kyu_readphysical.m was modified so that :
- it excludes the instances with a missing class 
- pts w/o a class value are assigned 0 for an array pts_to_include
  which will be filtered out by kyu_preprocess.m 
- study IDs for the removed patients are displayed
* kyu_BN_readdata now displays an event rate on a command window
- event rate is defined as a fraction of class==2
