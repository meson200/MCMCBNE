* created a new import function kyu_BN_readdata.m 
This is different from the obsolete kyu_BN_readdata_combine.m in: 
- it reads data from all the institutions from a single file
- Accordingly, patient identifier (studyid) has a new format 
  institution + 3 digit ID (ex:L002)
- endpoint(class) can be customized (class_name)
- missing data is excluded from odds ratio calculation
* changes in kyu_readphysical.m
- users can specify which variable should be a class through
  an input argument class_name
